👋 Hi, there! I am Yan Chen (陈炎), an Assistant Professor and Master's Supervisor at [Xi'an Jiaotong University] (西安交通大学)(https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). My research focuses on integrating advanced mechanical analysis with artificial intelligence tools to develop innovative solutions for real-world engineering problems. I specialize in multi-scale mechanical analysis - from quantum mechanics (DFT) and molecular dynamics to continuum mechanics and phase-field modeling - to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical engineering applications.

**Recent researches:**
- 🔬 Continuum mechanics modeling of micro/nano composites with microstructural considerations
- 🌡️ Environmental effects on entropic elasticity and conformational mechanics of low-dimensional materials
- 🦾 Bio-inspired design of composite materials for enhanced fracture and fatigue resistance
- 🤖 Development of intelligent design platforms for materials and structures driven by both data and mechanical principles

**Recent Achievements:**

- 📚 I have published more than 30+ papers in top international journals <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G3gPDo0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2YanChen32%2yanchen32.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> Notable publications include：
  - *Journal of the Mechanics and Physics of Solids* (4 papers)
  - *Nature Communications*
  - *Nano Letters* (2 papers)
  - *Engineering Fracture Mechanics*
- 🏆 Awards and Honors:
  - Type-A Young Elite Talent Award, XJTU
  - Youth Talent Support Program, Xi'an Association for Science and Technology
- 💻 One registered software copyright (LayerMech V1.0)
